### Dependency Inversion Principle (D)

The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) is one of the five principles in the SOLID object-oriented design principles. It states:

1. High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
2. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

In practical terms, this means that:

- **Abstraction:** In C#, this often involves creating interfaces or abstract classes that define the contract or behavior expected from concrete implementations.
  
  ```csharp
  public interface ILogger
  {
      void Log(string message);
  }
  ```

- **Implementation:** Concrete classes should depend on abstractions rather than the other way around. This allows for flexibility and easier maintenance as you can swap implementations without changing high-level code.

  ```csharp
  public class FileLogger : ILogger
  {
      public void Log(string message)
      {
          // Logic to log to a file
      }
  }
  ```

- **Dependency Injection:** DIP is often implemented using techniques like Dependency Injection (DI), where the dependencies of a class are injected from the outside rather than created internally.

  ```csharp
  public class SomeService
  {
      private readonly ILogger _logger;

      public SomeService(ILogger logger)
      {
          _logger = logger;
      }

      public void DoSomething()
      {
          _logger.Log("Doing something...");
      }
  }
  ```

By adhering to the Dependency Inversion Principle, your code becomes more modular, maintainable, and easier to test, as it promotes loose coupling between components and facilitates the replacement of implementations without affecting the overall architecture.
